* Real-Time Messaging Application in Golang

** Introduction

Building a real-time messaging application in Golang can be achieved using WebSocket technology.

** Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of the Go programming language
- Familiarity with WebSocket communication

** Steps to Develop

*** Step 1: Setting Up the Project


*** Step 2: Import Required Packages

- Import the "net/http" package for creating the HTTP server.
- Import the "github.com/gorilla/websocket" package for WebSocket communication.

*** Step 3: Create WebSocket Handlers

- Create a WebSocket upgrade handler that upgrades HTTP connections to WebSocket connections.
- Initialize a WebSocket connection using the "Upgrader" from the "github.com/gorilla/websocket" package.

*** Step 4: Handle Incoming Messages

- In the WebSocket handler, create a loop to continuously read messages from the WebSocket connection.
- Handle incoming messages and perform appropriate actions.

*** Step 5: Broadcast Messages

- Implement a mechanism to broadcast messages to all connected clients.
- Maintain a list of active WebSocket connections and use channels to send messages to all clients.

*** Step 6: Client-Side Implementation

- Create a basic HTML and JavaScript front-end for the messaging application.
- Use the JavaScript WebSocket API to connect to the server and send/receive messages.

*** Step 7: Testing and Running

- Start the Go application using the command: `go run main.go`
- Access the client-side interface in a web browser to test real-time messaging.
